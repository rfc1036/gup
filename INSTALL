		How to make and install gup
		===========================


gup is known to work on:

	o	NETBSD 0.8a
	o	SunOS 4.1.2, SunOS 4.1.3
	o	Ultrix V4.3

Maybe you can help us add to this list?


How to make gup
---------------

If you are familiar with news and net sources, edit the Makefile and
run "make install".

If you are new to net sources (you probably don't want this program
however), do the following:


1)	Unshar


2)	Nominate the appropriate config file in the Makefile.

	Select the appropriate file from the ./config directory that
	matches your system.

	If none of the existing config files work for you system, you
	will need to create one for your system. Take a copy of
	config/TEMPLATE as a starting point. Doco is include in there.


3)	Edit the other parameters in the Makefile to suit your
	news installation. You need to know the location of you
	"active" file and a bit about your mail system.

4)	Run "make" or "make install"

	"make install" copies the executable and manpage.


How to install gup
------------------

Gup is a mail-server program that has been designed to be place in a
.forward such that inbound mails are fed into gup via stdin.
Furthermore, gup needs a home directory and a 'config' file before it
can be used. While you are not constrained to any particular
arrangement, this section outlines the setup we use. I'm assuming that
only news administrators will be installing gup so I'm not going to spell
out the obvious.

1.	Create a 'gup' user in your /etc/passwd file. It doesn't have
	to be called 'gup'. You may want an alias for 'gup' if you
	want to use a 'formal' mail address for gup such as
	"news-update" or some such.

2.	Create a home directory for 'gup' with appropriate
	permissions.

3.	Create a 'config' file in gup's home directory.

	This file has one line per site. Each line contains three
	white-space separated tokens: sitename, mailid, and password.
	Eg:

	werple	frodo3$_dItz34	andrew@apana.org.au
	torps	Za67H122ph__	zaph@torps

	For testing purposes, place this line in there:

	test	test		mymailid

	Where mymailid is your mail id.

	When a remote administrator sends in a request, the 'site'
	command must have a host and password that matches the entry
	in the 'config' file so keep this file well protected!


4.	Create a .forward file in gup's home directory so that all
	inbound mails are fed to the gup program. Here's what mine
	looks like:

"|/home/gup/bin/gup -d /home/gup -l /var/log/gup -m /home/gup/mail_headers"

	All the options etc are explained in the manpage so they're
	not covered here.

And that's it! You are now ready to give gup a blast. Send it some
mail with the following in the body of the mail:

	site  test test
	include comp.source*
	exclude *misc*
	list
	newsgroups comp.protocol*
	quit


After you've had a bit of a play, have a read of the manpage to
learn about the mail headers file and such.


Integration with your news system.
----------------------------------

If you've got this far, then the next question is how to get the
site's group files integrated back into your news systems. The short
answer is that you need to write yourself a shell script to do this.

To get you started, there is a sample for inn in scripts/gupdate. It
does nothing smart really. All it does is concatenate a global header
with each sites local header, groups and trailer, then a glocal
trailer into a tentative newsfeeds file. The only slight trick is to
use sed to make it amenable to inn's format.

We actually use this script ourselves, it is run once a night from
cron.
